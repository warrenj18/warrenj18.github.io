title: Data Scientists

Being a data scientist is all about taking data & using it to solve problems or scenarios that come up in the real world. They need to understand how to code & use software to get answers to problems involving data. They should probably also know machine learning techniques. 

Data scientists take lots of data, put it through software, & use it to solve problems whereas statisticians are using the main ideas from statistics to analyze data. They are definitely more intertwined nowadays in that statisticians need to be able to use software to solve problems, and data scientists need to be able to understand statistics to analyze data & solve problems. The world today is primarily focused on technology so the two disciplines definitely complement each other. I see myself as more of a statistician than a data scientist, but I'm excited to learn the skills necessary to becoming a data scientist!
